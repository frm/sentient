# Triangles

Found in [Sentient's exercise pdf](https://sentient-lang.org/exercises.pdf)

A pythagorean triple is a solution to the equation `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` such that `a`, `b` and `c` are positive integers. Equivalently, they are right-angle triangles with whole numbers for sides.

**a) Find five different pythagorean triples**

**b) How many pythagorean triples are there such that `c < 30`?**

Note: (`a=3, b=4, c=5`) should be counted the same as (`a=4, b=3, c=5`)

**c) Demonstrate that there are no solutions for cubes up to 500**

Hint: The default ‘int’ type ranges from -128 to 127. You’ll need something bigger.

**d) [challenging] Find a spiral of pythagorean triples.**
